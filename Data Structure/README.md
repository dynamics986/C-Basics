# Data Structures Programming Assignments

This repository contains my implementations for programming assignments in my **Data Structures** course in CUHK. Each project demonstrates fundamental concepts through practical coding solutions.

## Repository Structure

- Organized by assignment topics (e.g., linked lists, trees, graphs)
- Contains both implementation files and test cases
- All code follows course guidelines and best practices

## Key Features

✅ **Test Case Included**:  
   - `input5.txt` serves as a test case for file `3.44.c` 
   - Ready-to-use for verification and debugging

✅ **Academic Focus**:  
   - Clean, commented code for educational purposes  
   - Emphasis on algorithmic efficiency
   - Proper memory management

✅ **Course-Ready**:  
   - Meets all assignment specifications  
   - Modular for easy adaptation  
   - Standardized I/O formats

## Usage Instructions

1. Compile: `gcc 3.44.c -o ds_program`
2. Run with test case: `./ds_program < input5.txt`
3. Verify output against expected results

*Note: All implementations were completed independently for course credit.*
