Many engineer beginners need to learn C language as it is a low-level but powerful programming language. Learning C can also help you understand how computer works. 
Therefore, I am going to share some of my coding when I was a beginner. These segments of coding covers different topics like characters, strings, structures and arrays. Feel free to learn from these materials. Try to understand the logoc and aims of these codes. Hopefully you can get some insights from them.
