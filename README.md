# C Programming Learning Materials

Many engineer beginners need to learn C language as it is a low-level but powerful programming language. Learning C can also help you understand how computers work.

Therefore, I am going to share some of my coding examples from when I was a beginner. These code segments cover different topics, include but not limit to:

- Characters
- Strings
- Structures
- Arrays

Feel free to learn from these materials. Try to understand the logic and purpose behind these codes. Hopefully, you can gain some insights from them.

## Topics Covered

1. **Characters**: Basic character operations and ASCII manipulations
2. **Strings**: String handling, manipulation, and common algorithms
3. **Structures**: Working with custom data types and their applications
4. **Arrays**: Single and multi-dimensional array operations

## How to Use These Materials

1. Browse through the code examples
2. Try to understand the logic before running them
3. Experiment by modifying the code
4. Apply similar concepts in your own programs

## Contribution

If you find any issues or have improvements to suggest, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Happy coding!
