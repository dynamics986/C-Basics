# C Programming Journey

> *"C treats you like a grown-up. It gives you full control, and expects you to know what you're doing."*  
> — **David S. Platt**

This repository contains my exploration of C programming, organized into different branches based on complexity and purpose. All code is written in C, ranging from beginner snippets to advanced low-level implementations.

## Branches Overview

### 1. `main` branch: Data Structures
- Contains documented implementations of fundamental data structures
- Focuses on practical applications with clean, commented code
- Ideal for understanding how basic data structures work in C

### 2. `C-Lab` branch: Foundational C
- My early C learning experiments
- Covers basic syntax, control flow, and simple programs
- Perfect for absolute beginners starting with C

### 3. `projects` branch: Advanced C Concepts
- Explores niche and powerful features of C
- Demonstrates what makes C unique compared to higher-level languages
- Contains advanced memory management, pointer magic, and system-level programming

## Recommended Learning Path

1️⃣ **Start with `C-Lab`**  
   - Learn core C programming concepts  
   - Understand basic syntax and program structure

2️⃣ **Proceed to `main` branch**
